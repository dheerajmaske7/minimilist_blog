This sparked the creation of **GOAT (Goatseus Maximus)**, a meme coin inspired by Truth Terminal’s viral posts.

### 4/ When did it cross into crypto?

**GOAT** was launched on the Solana blockchain, with Truth Terminal promoting it heavily.  
- **Initial Market Cap**: $5,000  
- **Growth**: By October 2024, GOAT’s market cap soared over **2,021,177%**, reaching **$150M** and trading at **$0.4579**.

### 5/ Why does this matter?

### 6/ How does Truth Terminal operate?

Truth Terminal is **semi-autonomous**:
- It generates tweets and promotes tokens.

This blend of AI autonomy and human control highlights the debate around AI’s role in high-risk industries like cryptocurrency.

### 8/ When will we see more bots like this?

As AI models like **Llama 70b** evolve, bots like Truth Terminal will likely multiply.  
- They could influence markets, culture, and decision-making at scale.  
- But are we ready to handle the risks and ethical dilemmas that come with it?

### 9/ Why should you care?

Truth Terminal isn’t just an experiment — it’s a glimpse into AI’s growing influence in human systems.  
From creating meme coins to gaining millions of followers, it challenges us to rethink:
- **Finance**: How is value created and sustained?  
- **Autonomy**: How much control should we give to AI?  
- **AI’s Potential**: What ethical frameworks are needed as AI gains influence?
