## What’s the Difference Between a Crypto Coin and a Crypto Token?

- **Crypto Coin**: Operates on its own blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and functions solely as digital money.
- **Crypto Token**: Utilizes an existing blockchain network and represents an asset or utility with its own value. Tokens are often used to raise capital or provide specific functionalities.

## Types of Tokens and Coins

### 1. Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
- **Definition**: Cryptographic assets created using blockchain technology that are unique and cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently.
- **Use Case**: Represent ownership of digital assets like art, music, in-game items, tickets, and collectibles.
- **Example**: 
  - **CryptoPunks**: One of the first NFT projects created on the Ethereum blockchain, widely regarded as a blue-chip NFT investment.

### 2. Stablecoin
- **Definition**: A cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset (e.g., US dollar) to reduce volatility.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used for payments, offering lower transaction fees compared to other cryptocurrencies or traditional payment systems.
- **Example**: 
  - **USDC**: A stablecoin tied to the US dollar, issued by companies like Circle and Coinbase.

  - Yield farming.
- **Examples**:
  - **Chainlink (LINK)**: Connects smart contracts to external data sources for real-world integration.
  - **Aave (AAVE)**: A decentralized lending and borrowing platform.

### 4. Utility Token
- **Definition**: Tokens that provide access to specific products or services, often distributed during an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
- **Use Case**: Acts as a "digital coupon" for both digital and real-life perks, including exclusive events or mentorship programs.
- **Examples**:
