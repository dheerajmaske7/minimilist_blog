# Concern of Re-centralization: Deepin

## What Is Deepin?

Deepin stands for **Distributed Electronic End-to-End Payment Infrastructure Network**. It is a blockchain-based framework being developed by central banks and major commercial banks to enable secure, programmable, and even **offline digital payments**.

The idea is to build the next layer of financial plumbing that supports **CBDCs, stablecoins, and tokenized deposits**, in a way that works both online and offline.

## Why Was Deepin Needed?

Existing payment systems such as **SWIFT, Visa, and Mastercard** are:
- Slow
- Costly
- Fragmented
- Dependent on constant internet connectivity

In an increasingly digital and global economy, this creates inefficiencies.

Deepin is designed to address three main needs:

- **Speed** – instant settlement of transactions  
- **Interoperability** – different systems working together (for example, UPI in India connecting with PayNow in Singapore)  
- **Resilience** – the ability to make payments even when the internet is unavailable  

---

## Who Is Implementing Deepin?

The **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** is leading trials with central banks such as:
- The European Central Bank  
- The People’s Bank of China  
- The Monetary Authority of Singapore  

Major commercial banks are also directly involved, including:
- J.P. Morgan  
- HSBC  
- Citi  
- UBS  
- Goldman Sachs  

This makes sense, as tokenized deposits and wholesale payments fall squarely within their domain.

## How Are Offline Payments Enabled?

Offline payments in Deepin rely on a combination of **hardware and protocols**.

Instead of money existing only in an app, value is stored securely in a **chip inside your phone or card**, similar to the secure element used in Apple Pay or SIM cards.

When two users meet without internet:
- They can transfer value using **NFC, Bluetooth, or QR codes**
- The transaction happens **locally**, without contacting a server

For example, imagine buying a coffee in a subway station with no network:
- Your phone balance decreases by $5  
- The merchant’s phone balance increases by $5  
- Everything happens offline  

When either party reconnects to the internet, the blockchain updates the central ledger. This ensures consistency and prevents fraud.

## A Real-World Example

China’s **digital yuan (e-CNY)** already supports offline payments for subway rides and small retail purchases.

The European Central Bank is piloting a similar concept with an **offline euro**.

Deepin aims to make this capability **universal**, rather than limited to a single metro or closed system like OMNY in New York.

## Concerns of Re-centralization

While the technology is promising, I believe there is a real risk that Deepin could **re-centralize financial power**, much like how Visa and Mastercard dominate card payments today.

Several factors contribute to this risk:

- **Trust and regulation** – Regulators trust banks more than crypto startups  
- **Client base** – Banks already hold deposits and relationships with governments and corporations  
- **Network effects** – The more banks and clients adopt Deepin, the harder it becomes for others to compete  

Together, this creates the possibility of a **monopoly or cartel**, where a small group of global banks and central banks control digital cash infrastructure.

---

## Network Effects and Monopoly Risk

Network effects mean that the more people use a system, the more valuable it becomes.

In the short term, the risk of monopoly is high:
- Only large banks can afford the infrastructure
- Compliance costs are significant

In the long term, the risk could reduce if Deepin evolves into a truly open protocol. However, history shows that **oligopolies often emerge naturally** when infrastructure is expensive and heavily regulated.

---

## Why Is This a Problem?

Blockchain originally promised **decentralization**—a system where no single institution controls money.

If Deepin becomes dominated by a few banks:
- Innovation could slow down  
- Competition could be reduced  
- Systemic risk could increase if those institutions fail  

This would represent a **new form of centralization**, even if the underlying technology is blockchain-based.

---

## The Counter View

Supporters argue that some level of centralization is unavoidable.

Offline payments require:
- Trust  
- Security  
- Compliance  

These are areas where regulated institutions currently have an advantage.

Unlike Visa or Mastercard, Deepin could be designed as an **open standard**, allowing banks, fintechs, and central banks to participate. In that case, it could resemble the **TCP/IP of money**, rather than another closed payments network.

---

## Closing Note

I’m intentionally keeping this article **open-ended**.

Deepin could become a powerful, inclusive financial infrastructure—or it could quietly re-centralize control under a new name.

I’m curious to hear what you think.
