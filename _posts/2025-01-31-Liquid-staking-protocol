# Talk on Liquid Staking Protocol at NYU STERN Blockchain Lab

Thanks to **[Gustavo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-grivol-782170201/?originalSubdomain=br)** and **[Professor Hannah](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/hanna-halaburda)** for the opportunity to speak at **[Blockchain Lab NYU](https://blockchain.stern.nyu.edu/)**.

## **Introduction**
With Ethereum's transition from **Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** in 2022, staking became the primary method of securing the network. However, traditional staking presented several challenges, such as **liquidity lockups, high entry barriers, and exit restrictions**. 

**Liquid Staking** emerged as a solution, allowing users to stake their assets while maintaining liquidity. This blog explores **how liquid staking works, its benefits, and its relationship with restaking protocols**.

## **The Problem with Traditional Staking**
In the **PoS model**, validators secure the network by staking a fixed amount of ETH (e.g., **32 ETH for Ethereum**). Users, on the other hand, delegate their assets to validators. However, this traditional staking method comes with several limitations:

- **Locked Assets:** Once staked, assets become illiquid and unusable for other purposes.
- **High Entry Barriers:** Becoming a validator requires a significant investment (~$75,000 for 32 ETH).
- **Limited Yield Opportunities:** Users only earn the **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** from staking without additional yield generation.
- **Unstaking Delays & Exit Restrictions:** Withdrawals are subject to long waiting periods.

To address these issues, **liquid staking protocols** were introduced.

## **What is Liquid Staking?**
Liquid Staking allows users to stake their **ETH without locking their assets**. In return, they receive **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)**, such as **stETH (staked ETH) from Lido**. These LSTs can be utilized in **DeFi applications for lending, trading, and yield farming**, all while continuing to earn staking rewards.

### **How Liquid Staking Works**
1. **Users deposit ETH** into a liquid staking protocol (e.g., Lido).
2. **The protocol stakes ETH** on behalf of the users by delegating to validators.
3. **Users receive LSTs** (e.g., stETH), representing their staked ETH.
4. **LSTs remain tradable and usable in DeFi**, ensuring liquidity while earning staking rewards.

## **How Are Rewards Distributed?**
Rewards from liquid staking are distributed **proportionally** based on the staked ETH and the performance of validators.

## **The Positive Feedback Loop of Liquid Staking**
Liquid Staking creates a **self-reinforcing cycle** that strengthens Ethereum’s ecosystem:

1. **More Liquid Staking →** Users can stake ETH while maintaining liquidity.
2. **More Validators →** Increased validator participation enhances decentralization.
3. **Lower Transaction Costs →** Higher competition among validators improves efficiency.
4. **Increased ETH Demand →** As staking becomes more accessible, demand for ETH rises.
5. **More Staking →** A larger percentage of ETH gets staked, securing the network further.
6. **More Liquidity →** The cycle continues, reinforcing Ethereum’s dominance.

This continuous loop enhances **network security and usability**, making staking more accessible to all.

## **How Restaking Extends Liquid Staking**
Liquid Staking **doesn’t stop at Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet)**. Restaking allows **LSTs (e.g., stETH) to be further utilized** in securing **Layer 2 networks, oracles, and bridges** through protocols like **EigenLayer**.

- **LSTs → EigenLayer Protocol → AVS (Actively Validated Services)**
- **AVS includes oracles, bridges, and Layer 2 solutions** that need additional security.
- **This creates new yield opportunities**, making Ethereum’s security model more robust.

Thus, **restaking amplifies the utility of LSTs**, further optimizing capital efficiency.

## **Categorization of Liquid Staking**
Liquid staking protocols fall into different categories based on **custodianship, decentralization, and governance models**:

- **Decentralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Lido):** Community-driven with distributed validators.
- **Centralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Binance, Coinbase):** Managed by centralized exchanges.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining elements of both decentralized and centralized models.

Each category offers **different trade-offs in security, decentralization, and risk exposure**.

## **PoSA’s Take on Liquid Staking**
The **Proof of Stake Alliance (PoSA)** advocates for **clear policies** surrounding liquid staking. Key points include:

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Involvement of bodies like **SEC, CFTC**.
- **Not a Taxable Event:** Swapping ETH for LSTs **is not considered a taxable event**.
- **Differentiating LSTs from LSDs (Liquid Staking Derivatives):** Ensuring clarity in financial products.
- **No Investment Advice:** Platforms like Lido **cannot provide financial recommendations**.

By promoting transparency, PoSA aims to **legitimize liquid staking under fair regulations**.

## **Risks Involved in Liquid Staking**
While liquid staking enhances staking efficiency, it introduces **several risks**:

1. **stETH Price Risk (Pegging Issues):** LSTs may **deviate from their pegged ETH value** in volatile markets.
2. **Regulatory Risk:** Governments and regulators **may impose restrictions** on staking protocols.
3. **Centralization Risk:** Large liquid staking providers (e.g., Lido) **could become too dominant**, affecting decentralization.
4. **Governance Risk:** Decision-making in **DAO-controlled protocols** may become complex or manipulated.
5. **Smart Contract Risk:** Exploits like **the Ankr hack (December 2022)** highlight potential security flaws.

Users must assess these risks before participating in liquid staking.

## **Conclusion: Why Liquid Staking Matters**
Liquid Staking **solves key limitations of traditional staking** by unlocking liquidity, reducing entry barriers, and increasing capital efficiency. It **creates a positive feedback loop** that strengthens Ethereum’s network security while enabling new DeFi opportunities.

Additionally, **restaking protocols extend staking benefits to Layer 2s, bridges, and oracles**, further enhancing Ethereum’s ecosystem.

As liquid staking evolves, **balancing decentralization, regulation, and security** will be crucial for its long-term success.
