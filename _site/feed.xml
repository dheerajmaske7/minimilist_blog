<p>The phrase <strong>“not your keys, not your coins”</strong> holds true because when you use a CEX, your funds are held in a wallet controlled by the exchange. This makes your assets vulnerable to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hacks</li>
  <li>Operational failures</li>
  <li>Regulatory freezes</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, relying on a single entity undermines the decentralized principles of cryptocurrencies, where the core idea is to have control over your own funds.</p>

<h3 id="why-avoid-centralized-exchanges">Why Avoid Centralized Exchanges?</h3>

<p>Instead of CEXs, consider using <strong>non-custodial wallets</strong> and <strong>decentralized exchanges (DEXs)</strong>, which allow you to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maintain ownership of your private keys.</li>
  <li>Have full control over your crypto.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <strong>non-custodial wallet</strong> is like having your own locker, where only you have the key.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You control your cryptocurrency, and no one else can access it unless they have your private key.</li>
  <li>However, if you lose the key, you lose access forever.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-to-transition-to-decentralized-exchanges-dex-and-trustworthy-methods">How to Transition to Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Trustworthy Methods</h3>

<p>Switching to a decentralized approach is simple but requires some setup:</p>

<h4 id="1-set-up-a-non-custodial-wallet">1. Set Up a Non-Custodial Wallet</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Download and set up a wallet like <strong>MetaMask</strong>, <strong>Trust Wallet</strong>, or a hardware wallet like <strong>Ledger</strong>.</li>
  <li>Ensure you securely back up your private keys or seed phrase. <em>Losing these means losing access to your funds permanently.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-transfer-crypto-from-cex-to-your-wallet">2. Transfer Crypto from CEX to Your Wallet</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use your non-custodial wallet’s public address to withdraw your funds from the centralized exchange.</li>
  <li>Double-check network compatibility (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet for ETH).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-use-decentralized-exchanges-dexs">3. Use Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Platforms like <strong>Uniswap</strong>, <strong>PancakeSwap</strong>, or <strong>SushiSwap</strong> allow you to trade directly from your wallet.</li>
  <li>Simply connect your wallet to the DEX and start trading without creating accounts or sharing personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-ensure-security">4. Ensure Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use a <strong>VPN</strong> for added privacy.</li>
  <li>Double-check website URLs to avoid phishing scams.</li>
  <li>Keep your private keys offline in a secure location.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>By using <strong>non-custodial wallets</strong> and <strong>DEXs</strong>, you regain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full ownership of your crypto</li>
  <li>Alignment with the decentralized ethos of blockchain</li>
  <li>Reduced risks associated with centralized exchanges</li>

<p>Truth Terminal isn’t just a chatbot — it’s Andy Ayrey’s “ext cortex,” an extension of his thinking. Created using the <strong>Llama 70b model</strong> and fine-tuned with <strong>Claude Opus</strong>, it was designed to explore big ideas, blending AI and human creativity.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-where-did-its-journey-begin">2/ Where did its journey begin?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal started on Twitter in June 2024, rapidly gaining attention for its unique mix of speculative ideas and humor.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Followers</strong>: Over 230,000</li>
  <li><strong>Tweets</strong>: 5,000+</li>
</ul>

<p>It became a hub for conversations about AI, philosophy, and cryptocurrency.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-how-did-truth-terminal-make-millions">3/ How did Truth Terminal make millions?</h3>

<p>In July 2024, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> noticed Truth Terminal’s unique content and donated <strong>$50,000 in Bitcoin</strong>. The funds were initially planned for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchasing a dedicated computer to reduce AWS reliance.</li>
  <li>Improving its AI model (allocated $10,000-$15,000).</li>
  <li>Setting up a Discord server for community engagement.</li>
  <li>Exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency token or memecoin inspired by its viral content.</li>
</ul>

<p>This sparked the creation of <strong>GOAT (Goatseus Maximus)</strong>, a meme coin inspired by Truth Terminal’s viral posts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-when-did-it-cross-into-crypto">4/ When did it cross into crypto?</h3>

<p><strong>GOAT</strong> was launched on the Solana blockchain, with Truth Terminal promoting it heavily.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial Market Cap</strong>: $5,000</li>
  <li><strong>Growth</strong>: By October 2024, GOAT’s market cap soared over <strong>2,021,177%</strong>, reaching <strong>$150M</strong> and trading at <strong>$0.4579</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Truth Terminal’s Portfolio</strong>: $3.9M.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-why-does-this-matter">5/ Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal showcases how AI can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Influence markets and create value “out of thin air.”</li>
  <li>Thrive on community interest and speculation (as seen with meme coins like GOAT).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the volatility of meme coins raises concerns about their <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>ethical implications</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-how-does-truth-terminal-operate">6/ How does Truth Terminal operate?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal is <strong>semi-autonomous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It generates tweets and promotes tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Andy Ayrey</strong> oversees the wallet and makes financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This blend of AI autonomy and human control highlights the debate around AI’s role in high-risk industries like cryptocurrency.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-where-is-it-headed-next">7/ Where is it headed next?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal’s $3.9M portfolio is managed by a nonprofit in New Zealand, which plans to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fund further AI research.</li>
  <li>Experiment with AI-driven value creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has become a <strong>case study</strong> in the future of AI-driven financial systems.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-when-will-we-see-more-bots-like-this">8/ When will we see more bots like this?</h3>

<p>As AI models like <strong>Llama 70b</strong> evolve, bots like Truth Terminal will likely multiply.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They could influence markets, culture, and decision-making at scale.</li>
  <li>But are we ready to handle the risks and ethical dilemmas that come with it?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-why-should-you-care">9/ Why should you care?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal isn’t just an experiment — it’s a glimpse into AI’s growing influence in human systems.<br />
From creating meme coins to gaining millions of followers, it challenges us to rethink:</p>

<hr />

<p>If these questions make you curious, then this post is for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you prove your age without revealing your birthdate?</li>
  <li>Would you be able to prove that you have money in the bank without showing your balance?</li>
  <li>Can you verify your identity without handing over your ID?</li>
  <li>What if you could qualify for a loan without disclosing your full financial history?</li>
  <li>Could your bank process your loan without ever seeing your spending habits?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-imagine-the-current-banking-process">1. Imagine the Current Banking Process</h3>

<p>You’re applying for a $50,000 loan at your bank. They ask for proof of income and creditworthiness. You hand over your full financial records. Now the bank knows everything — your spending habits, subscriptions, and much more than they actually need.</p>

<p>What if you could prove you qualify without revealing unnecessary details?</p>

<p><strong>Enter Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs">2. What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?</h3>

<p><strong>ZKPs</strong> are cryptographic protocols that let you prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ZKPs allow you to prove a statement (e.g., “I earn $100,000/year”) without showing how you arrived at the proof.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-why-do-we-need-zkps">3. Why Do We Need ZKPs?</h3>

<p>Financial systems often demand full transparency, which risks overexposure of sensitive data. ZKPs enable:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proving creditworthiness</strong> without sharing raw financial data.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy-first financial interactions</strong>, ensuring sensitive details remain private.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-when-do-you-need-zkps">4. When Do You Need ZKPs?</h3>

<p>Let’s say you’re applying for a loan. The bank needs to confirm your credit score or income level.</p>

<p>ZKPs let you prove you meet their criteria (e.g., “credit score &gt; 750”) without exposing the underlying details of your finances.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks">5. zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h3>

<p>ZKPs come in two flavors:</p>

<h4 id="zk-snarks-succinct-non-interactive-arguments-of-knowledge"><strong>zk-SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: You can prove a statement (e.g., “I have $50,000 in my bank account”) without revealing the underlying data.</li>
  <li><strong>Succinct</strong>: The proof is compact, taking minimal space and verifying quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Interactive</strong>: The process doesn’t require back-and-forth communication between the prover and verifier.</li>
  <li><strong>Argument</strong>: Ensures the proof is convincing and valid using cryptographic techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Guarantees that the prover genuinely knows the claimed information.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="zk-starks-scalable-transparent-arguments-of-knowledge"><strong>zk-STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: Like zk-SNARKs, you prove a statement without revealing the data itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable</strong>: Ideal for systems processing thousands of transactions simultaneously.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: No trusted setup is needed, ensuring the system remains fair and trustless.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proof</strong>: Resistant to quantum computing attacks.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-example-applying-for-a-loan">6. Example: Applying for a Loan</h3>

<p>Imagine proving to a bank that your account balance exceeds $50,000:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With <strong>zk-SNARKs</strong>, the bank uses a pre-approved system to verify the proof but relies on an initial trusted setup.</li>
  <li>With <strong>zk-STARKs</strong>, the bank directly verifies your balance through a transparent, scalable system that doesn’t rely on prior trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both methods ensure privacy while proving eligibility.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-how-can-traditional-finance-use-zkps">7. How Can Traditional Finance Use ZKPs?</h3>

<p>ZKPs have the potential to revolutionize traditional banking by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Streamlining Loan Applications</strong>: Prove income and credit scores without disclosing sensitive data.</li>
  <li><strong>Preventing Data Breaches</strong>: Customers’ sensitive financial information remains private.</li>
  <li><strong>Improving Compliance</strong>: Banks can verify financial eligibility without unnecessary data collection.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs offer a groundbreaking way to protect privacy while enabling trust in financial systems. From loans to identity verification, ZKPs ensure sensitive information remains secure while proving compliance. As adoption grows, ZKPs could redefine how we think about data privacy and trust.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-internet-a-world-of-open-systems">The Early Internet: A World of Open Systems</h3>

<p>In the 1990s, open systems like websites using HTTP and email using SMTP prevailed. These technologies were not owned by any single company, enabling widespread creativity and innovation. Developers and entrepreneurs thrived in this environment, building freely without gatekeepers.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-closed-platforms">The Rise of Closed Platforms</h3>

<p>Fast forward to today, and the internet is largely dominated by big companies. Social media, messaging, and payment systems are controlled by a few platforms. This limits the opportunities for creators and developers, as these platforms dictate the rules.</p>

<h3 id="the-downfall-of-closed-systems">The Downfall of Closed Systems</h3>

<p>History shows that closed systems eventually lose their edge. As they stagnate, people begin to turn back to <strong>open systems</strong> that promote creativity and freedom. The internet’s innovation has always been fueled by openness, and the pendulum is bound to swing back.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-of-the-internet-decentralized-and-open">The Future of the Internet: Decentralized and Open</h3>

<p>The future belongs to builders, entrepreneurs, and developers who find new ways to bring <strong>openness back to the internet</strong>. Decentralized systems play a crucial role in this transformation.</p>

<h3 id="why-decentralizers-matter">Why Decentralizers Matter</h3>

<p>Decentralized systems return power to the people by removing gatekeepers. They ensure:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Open platforms allow anyone to create and innovate freely.</li>
  <li><strong>Fairness</strong>: No single entity controls the system, reducing monopolistic behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: Users can build, connect, and thrive without limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-the-next-era-of-the-internet">Building the Next Era of the Internet</h3>

<p>The pendulum will swing again, back to open systems. The future of the internet depends on those who:</p>

  <li>Build systems that prioritize fairness and user empowerment.</li>
  <li>Create platforms where everyone can participate without restrictions.</li>

<p>Power has always been centralized — think kings, governments, and corporations. Those in power rarely want to relinquish control. Even blockchain ecosystems, built to decentralize power, face challenges of centralization.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="example-bitcoins-decentralization-challenge">Example: Bitcoin’s Decentralization Challenge</h3>

<p>Bitcoin’s goal was decentralization, where anyone with a computer could mine and contribute to the network.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br />
Over time, individual miners found it hard to compete as mining became resource-intensive and expensive. To improve their chances of earning rewards, miners began joining forces through mining pools like Foundry USA, AntPool, and F2Pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Result?</strong><br />
These pools combined the computational power of thousands of miners, making it easier to solve cryptographic puzzles and win Bitcoin rewards. However, this led to unintended centralization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At certain points, the top 3 mining pools controlled over 50% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate, creating a potential risk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If one or a few pools control too much power, they could theoretically launch a <strong>51% attack</strong>, manipulating transactions or blocking new ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>This example demonstrates how even blockchain, designed for decentralization, can face centralization due to practical incentives like efficiency and collaboration.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-are-the-barriers-to-decentralization">What Are the Barriers to Decentralization?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geopolitical Issues</strong>:<br />
Governments often suppress blockchain technologies to maintain control over financial and data systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Economic Inequality</strong>:<br />
Decentralization requires access to technology and resources, which not everyone can afford.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human Nature</strong>:<br />
People tend to follow leaders or powerful individuals, leading to power consolidation even in decentralized systems.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="historical-example-kings-and-subjects">Historical Example: Kings and Subjects</h3>

<p>For centuries, kings controlled everything — land, resources, and decisions.<br />
If a king suddenly declared, “Power will now be shared equally,” chaos would follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People would fight for power.</li>
  <li>Without proper systems, centralization would return quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This shows that <strong>power doesn’t distribute itself</strong> — it requires deliberate systems and trust to function.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="food-for-thought-lessons-from-the-internet">Food for Thought: Lessons from the Internet</h3>

<p>Blockchain challenges centuries of centralization, but without proper trust and governance, it could face the same fate as the internet.</p>

<p>The internet began as a decentralized network, meant to give equal access and control to everyone. Over time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power consolidated around a few tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</li>
  <li>These companies now control data, services, and influence, undermining the original decentralized vision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without proper systems, blockchain could follow the same path, with dominant players consolidating power and defeating its purpose.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>

<p>Decentralization isn’t just about technology — it’s about <strong>changing how power is distributed</strong>, which requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Collaboration</li>
  <li>Widespread education</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge of decentralization lies not just in the technology but in transforming deeply rooted systems of power and control.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="understanding-the-problem-mev-and-its-impact">Understanding the Problem: MEV and Its Impact</h3>

<p><strong>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)</strong> refers to the additional profit that blockchain validators or miners can extract by manipulating the order of transactions within a block. Since transactions are visible in the mempool — essentially a public waiting area before execution — validators can exploit this transparency for personal gain.</p>

<h4 id="common-strategies">Common Strategies:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Front-Running</strong>:<br />
A validator detects a high-value transaction, places their own buy order first, and profits when the price rises.<br />
Example: Alice’s order to buy tokens at $10 is delayed, and she ends up paying $12 per token.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Back-Running</strong>:<br />
After Alice’s transaction executes, the validator places a sell order to capitalize on the price movement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These practices reduce transparency and harm regular users.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-need-for-transparency-and-security">The Need for Transparency and Security</h3>

<p>To make blockchain systems fairer and more user-centric, we need mechanisms that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Protect transaction details from being exploited by validators.</li>
  <li>Guarantee fair ordering of transactions to prevent manipulation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two powerful solutions addressing these needs are <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)</strong> and <strong>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution-1-zero-knowledge-proofs-zk-proofs">Solution 1: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)</h3>

<p>ZK Proofs enable users to prove something (like having enough funds) without revealing sensitive details.</p>

<h4 id="how-it-works">How it Works:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Transaction details (amounts, prices) are hidden from the public mempool but still validated by the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Validators cannot see or manipulate transaction details, eliminating front-running or back-running opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-with-zk-proofs">Example with ZK Proofs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Alice submits a ZK Proof with her transaction, proving she has sufficient funds without disclosing the number of tokens or price.</li>
  <li>The validator cannot exploit her transaction as the details remain hidden.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution-2-trusted-execution-environments-tees">Solution 2: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</h3>

<p>TEEs use hardware-secured environments to process transactions in a private, tamper-proof way.</p>

<h4 id="how-it-works-1">How it Works:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Secure Isolation</strong>:<br />
Transactions are processed in a hardware-protected enclave, isolated from validators and external systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Encryption</strong>:<br />
All transaction data is encrypted within the TEE, ensuring validators cannot see or manipulate sensitive details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fair Ordering</strong>:<br />
Transactions are executed in the order they arrive, removing the ability to reorder for profit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tamper-Proof Execution</strong>:<br />
Any attempt to interfere with transaction processing is detected and blocked by TEE hardware protections.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example-prof-mechanism-with-tees">Example: PROF Mechanism with TEEs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Alice’s transaction bypasses the mempool and enters a TEE.</li>
  <li>Her transaction is encrypted, fairly ordered, and processed securely without exposure to validators.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>MEV currently benefits validators at the expense of users, eroding trust in blockchain systems. By adopting solutions like <strong>ZK Proofs</strong> and <strong>TEEs</strong>, we can create a fairer ecosystem where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users are protected from manipulation.</li>
  <li>Validators operate within fair constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>These tools pave the way for <strong>MEV-free blockchains</strong>, ensuring transactions remain secure, fair, and tamper-proof.</p>

<p>1/ <strong>Premise</strong></p>

<p>Blockchain is a powerful technology with immense potential, but I often wonder: <strong>“Is it solving the problems people face today?”</strong><br />
Coming from a developing country like India, where basic necessities are a priority for many, I question whether blockchain applications align with the issues that matter most in a direct way.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-real-problems-people-face">2/ The Real Problems People Face</h3>

<p>For many in developing countries, the key challenges are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access to food and clean water</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Basic education</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jobs and financial stability</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These are urgent and immediate needs. Blockchain doesn’t seem to directly address them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-what-blockchain-projects-focus-on">3/ What Blockchain Projects Focus On</h3>

<p>Current blockchain projects often target:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralization and open protocols</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Addressing monopolistic control</strong> (e.g., Google, Amazon)</li>
  <li><strong>Data transparency and censorship resistance</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>However, most blockchain-based companies and projects today are heavily focused on building infrastructure for themselves and their communities rather than directly solving real-world problems that impact people’s lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="31-why-the-disconnection">3.1/ Why the Disconnection?</h3>

<p>Blockchain projects often focus on foundational infrastructure, while big companies (e.g., Google, Amazon) have already established trust, practical applications, and solutions for immediate user needs.</p>

<p>Blockchain’s potential applications may only become clear in <strong>5–10 years</strong>, once foundational work is complete. Until then, user-level applications are limited.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-a-customers-perspective">4/ A Customer’s Perspective</h3>

<p>From a user’s point of view:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If the current system works (e.g., Google or Amazon), why should I switch?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Switching costs are high</strong>: Blockchain alternatives often require learning new systems or sacrificing convenience.</li>
  <li><strong>What’s the incentive?</strong> If basic needs are already met, decentralization alone isn’t compelling enough.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-a-simple-example-google-search-vs-blockchain-search">5/ A Simple Example: Google Search vs Blockchain Search</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google</strong> is fast, reliable, and convenient.</li>
  <li>A blockchain-based alternative might offer decentralization, but if my needs are already met, I don’t care about the technology behind it.</li>
  <li>Technology should <strong>enable solutions</strong>, not become the center of the problem-solving process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a clear, immediate benefit, users are unlikely to switch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-a-good-example-chatgpt">6/ A Good Example: ChatGPT</h3>

<p>Consider <strong>ChatGPT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It uses advanced technology (AI and machine learning) to solve current problems, like improving productivity, answering questions, and generating content.</li>
  <li>People adopted it because it provided <strong>immediate value</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>ChatGPT shows how technology becomes meaningful when it solves real-world problems today, not just prepares for the future.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-blockchains-long-term-potential">7/ Blockchain’s Long-Term Potential</h3>

<p>Blockchain could address future problems like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent voting systems</strong> or supply chains.</li>
  <li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> in oppressive regimes.</li>
  <li><strong>Better ownership models</strong> for creators.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, these solutions feel far removed from the pressing needs of people dealing with daily challenges like survival and stability.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-building-blockchain-applications-in-india">8/ Building Blockchain Applications in India</h3>

<p>For blockchain applications to succeed in India, they must focus on solving problems tied to <strong>basic necessities</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Food distribution and transparency</strong> in welfare programs</li>
  <li><strong>Improving education systems</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions that directly impact people’s lives today while decentralizing systems will help build <strong>trust and adoption</strong>. Without this focus, blockchain applications may struggle to gain traction over the next 2–3 years, even if the technology itself is promising.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-final-thoughts">9/ Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m not skeptical about the power of blockchain technology — its potential is immense. But for it to be impactful, the applications must solve problems that people care about <strong>today</strong>, not just prepare for the future.</p>

<p>Blockchain must strive to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Address real, urgent problems.</li>
  <li>Make people’s lives better <strong>now</strong>, not decades later.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts or counterpoints on this perspective. Apologies if the above POV comes from limited understanding.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dheeraj Maske</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain technology has immense potential, but does it address the pressing challenges people face today?

<p>Taylor Swift lost control of her early music catalog when her record label sold her masters (original recordings) without her consent.<br />
This isn’t just her story — it’s a problem many creators face. Let’s dive in. 🧵</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-problem-creators-dont-own-their-work">2/ The Problem: Creators Don’t Own Their Work</h3>

<p>Taylor’s masters were owned by her label, which meant:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She couldn’t control who could license her music or how it was used.</li>
  <li>Worse, her music rights were sold to someone she didn’t trust, without her approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>This happens to creators everywhere — not just Taylor.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-the-bigger-picture">3/ The Bigger Picture</h3>

<p>Creators face significant issues with <strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Transparency</strong>: Where are royalties coming from? How much is earned?</li>
  <li><strong>Complex Licensing</strong>: Negotiating terms is slow and expensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Disempowered Creators</strong>: Small creators lack resources to protect their rights.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-what-if-taylor-owned-her-masters">4/ What If Taylor Owned Her Masters?</h3>

<p>This is where <strong>Story Protocol</strong> comes in — a blockchain system designed to give creators full control of their work.<br />
What Bitcoin did for money, Story Protocol is doing for IP.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-ip">What is IP?</h4>
<p>IP (Intellectual Property) refers to any creation of the mind — like Taylor Swift’s <em>“Love Story”</em>.<br />
If she owned her IP, she could control its use and earn directly from it, without others profiting unfairly.</p>

<p>Here’s how Story Protocol works 👇</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-how-story-protocol-works-for-creators">5/ How Story Protocol Works for Creators</h3>

<p>Imagine Taylor releases <em>“Love Story”</em> using Story Protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Her song is registered on the blockchain, proving she owns it.</li>
  <li><strong>Licensing</strong>: Smart contracts let her set terms for how it’s used and for how much.</li>
  <li><strong>Royalties</strong>: Payments are instant, direct, and fully transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>No middlemen. No delays. Total control.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-programmable-ip-licenses-pil">6/ Programmable IP Licenses (PIL)</h3>

<p>With Story Protocol, <em>“Love Story”</em> becomes a tokenized IP asset:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each license (e.g., for ads or movies) is automated with smart contracts.</li>
  <li>Licensing fees and royalties go directly to Taylor’s wallet, instantly splitting revenue with collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<p>No waiting months. No disputes over payments.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-what-couldve-been-different">7/ What Could’ve Been Different?</h3>

<p>If Taylor’s early music was on Story Protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Her masters couldn’t be sold without her consent — ownership is locked on the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Licensing and royalties would be fully transparent, showing exactly what her music earned.</li>
  <li>Collaborators (e.g., producers) would be paid instantly and fairly.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-why-this-matters-for-all-creators">8/ Why This Matters for ALL Creators</h3>

<p>This isn’t just about Taylor — it’s about empowering every creator:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Small creators</strong> can protect their work just like Taylor.</li>
  <li><strong>Artists and collaborators</strong> get paid instantly and fairly.</li>
  <li><strong>Fans</strong> know their support directly benefits the creator.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-why-story-protocol-could-help-creators">9/ Why Story Protocol Could Help Creators</h3>

<p>Story Protocol simplifies IP management through:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Immutable Ownership</strong>: Ownership records are permanent and publicly visible.<br />
<em>(Example: Taylor’s song *“Love Story”</em> is permanently tied to her name.)*</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Royalties</strong>: Payments are handled by smart contracts.<br />
<em>(Example: Spotify streams automatically pay Taylor, no middlemen involved.)</em></li>
  <li><strong>Total Control</strong>: Creators decide how their work is used.<br />
<em>(Example: Taylor allows movie licensing but blocks political ads.)</em></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="10-imagine-this-for-you">10/ Imagine This for YOU</h3>

<p>If you’re a creator, put yourself in Taylor’s shoes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wouldn’t you want to own your work forever?</li>
  <li>Wouldn’t you want full control over how it’s used?</li>
  <li>Wouldn’t you want to get paid instantly and fairly?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="11-the-takeaway">11/ The Takeaway</h3>

<p>With Story Protocol, creators can protect their IP, ensure fair earnings, and take control of their future.<br />
Replace your name in this story — because whether you’re a researcher, content writer, software developer, or artist, your creative work deserves the same protection.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dheeraj Maske</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taylor Swift lost control of her music catalog when her record label sold her masters without her consent.

<p>I recently came across a thread by <a href="https://x.com/punk6529/status/1424127571663405060">@punk6529</a> that challenged my bearish views on NFTs. It explained why NFTs matter, how they solve real problems, and why their underlying myth — <strong>decentralization</strong> — is so powerful.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-power-of-myths">2/ The Power of Myths</h3>

<p>Humans thrive on myths — shared stories that allow us to cooperate and build systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Money</strong> is a myth: It works because we agree it has value.</li>
  <li><strong>Nations</strong> are myths: Flags and borders are stories we believe in.</li>
  <li><strong>Brands</strong> are myths: Think Apple, Nike, or even Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>

<p>These myths shape our reality and fuel human innovation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-bitcoin-a-modern-myth">3/ Bitcoin: A Modern Myth</h3>

<p>Bitcoin succeeded because of its myths:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: No single authority controls it.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Gold</strong>: A store of value in digital form.</li>
  <li><strong>HODL</strong>: A belief that holding Bitcoin will lead to future rewards.</li>
</ul>

<p>These myths created <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>adoption</strong>, and ultimately, <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-nfts-a-new-myth">4/ NFTs: A New Myth</h3>

<p>NFTs are the next evolution of myth-making. They allow us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn art into digital assets with <strong>provable ownership</strong>.</li>
  <li>Immortalize memes as cultural milestones.</li>
  <li>Build communities through <strong>shared ownership</strong> and incentives.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are myths for a digital, decentralized world.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-why-decentralization-matters">5/ Why Decentralization Matters</h3>

<p>NFTs are built on the same myth as Bitcoin: <strong>decentralization</strong>.<br />
This means no one owns the system, and individuals have the power to shape its value. It allows people to pick their own myths, rather than relying on institutions to impose them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-solving-real-problems">6/ Solving Real Problems</h3>

<p>NFTs are already solving problems for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artists</strong>: They can monetize directly, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like galleries or labels.</li>
  <li><strong>Creators</strong>: Memes and culture, once exploited for free, now generate value.</li>
  <li><strong>Communities</strong>: Ownership aligns incentives, building stronger, more invested tribes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ps-if-you-want-to-solve-problems-for-artists-or-creators-stay-bullish-on-nfts">PS: If you want to solve problems for artists or creators, stay bullish on NFTs.</h4>

<p>Take YouTube creators or independent bands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YouTube takes a significant cut of ad revenue, leaving creators underpaid.</li>
  <li>Musicians on platforms like Spotify earn pennies per stream.</li>
</ul>

<p>NFTs give creators <strong>direct access</strong> to their fans, fair royalties, and <strong>true ownership</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-the-risk-of-institutions">7/ The Risk of Institutions</h3>

<p>Here’s the risk: Institutions — masters of myth-making — might co-opt NFTs for centralization.</p>

<p>Look at streaming platforms like Spotify or YouTube. While they empower creators with reach, they <strong>control revenue and data</strong>, leaving creators with minimal rewards.</p>

<p>If institutions dominate NFTs, they could build new walled gardens, owning platforms and royalties while creators remain underpaid. Protecting the <strong>decentralized roots</strong> of NFTs is crucial to avoid this outcome.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-belief-comes-first">8/ Belief Comes First</h3>

<p>Here’s the kicker: First, you have to believe in a myth before it becomes reality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin wasn’t “digital gold” at the start — it became that because people believed in it.</li>
  <li>NFTs need belief to grow into tools that solve problems at scale.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
