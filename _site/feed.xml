<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>With Ethereum’s transition from <strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong> in 2022, staking became the primary method of securing the network. However, traditional staking presented several challenges, such as <strong>liquidity lockups, high entry barriers, and exit restrictions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Liquid Staking</strong> emerged as a solution, allowing users to stake their assets while maintaining liquidity. This blog explores <strong>how liquid staking works, its benefits, and its relationship with restaking protocols</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-staking"><strong>The Problem with Traditional Staking</strong></h2>
<p>In the <strong>PoS model</strong>, validators secure the network by staking a fixed amount of ETH (e.g., <strong>32 ETH for Ethereum</strong>). Users, on the other hand, delegate their assets to validators. However, this traditional staking method comes with several limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Locked Assets:</strong> Once staked, assets become illiquid and unusable for other purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>High Entry Barriers:</strong> Becoming a validator requires a significant investment (~$75,000 for 32 ETH).</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Yield Opportunities:</strong> Users only earn the <strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong> from staking without additional yield generation.</li>
  <li><strong>Unstaking Delays &amp; Exit Restrictions:</strong> Withdrawals are subject to long waiting periods.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these issues, <strong>liquid staking protocols</strong> were introduced.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-liquid-staking"><strong>What is Liquid Staking?</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking allows users to stake their <strong>ETH without locking their assets</strong>. In return, they receive <strong>Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)</strong>, such as <strong>stETH (staked ETH) from Lido</strong>. These LSTs can be utilized in <strong>DeFi applications for lending, trading, and yield farming</strong>, all while continuing to earn staking rewards.</p>

<h3 id="how-liquid-staking-works"><strong>How Liquid Staking Works</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Users deposit ETH</strong> into a liquid staking protocol (e.g., Lido).</li>
  <li><strong>The protocol stakes ETH</strong> on behalf of the users by delegating to validators.</li>
  <li><strong>Users receive LSTs</strong> (e.g., stETH), representing their staked ETH.</li>
  <li><strong>LSTs remain tradable and usable in DeFi</strong>, ensuring liquidity while earning staking rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\assets\images\Liquid_Staking_Protocol\Deposit_flow.jpg" alt="Liquid Staking Deposit Flow" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-are-rewards-distributed"><strong>How Are Rewards Distributed?</strong></h2>
<p>Rewards from liquid staking are distributed <strong>proportionally</strong> based on the staked ETH and the performance of validators.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\Liquid_Staking_Protocol\Reward_distribution.jpg" alt="Reward Distribution" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-positive-feedback-loop-of-liquid-staking"><strong>The Positive Feedback Loop of Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking creates a <strong>self-reinforcing cycle</strong> that strengthens Ethereum’s ecosystem:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>More Liquid Staking →</strong> Users can stake ETH while maintaining liquidity.</li>
  <li><strong>More Validators →</strong> Increased validator participation enhances decentralization.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower Transaction Costs →</strong> Higher competition among validators improves efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased ETH Demand →</strong> As staking becomes more accessible, demand for ETH rises.</li>
  <li><strong>More Staking →</strong> A larger percentage of ETH gets staked, securing the network further.</li>
  <li><strong>More Liquidity →</strong> The cycle continues, reinforcing Ethereum’s dominance.</li>
</ol>

<p>This continuous loop enhances <strong>network security and usability</strong>, making staking more accessible to all.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Liquid_Staking_Protocol/Positive_feedback_loop.jpg" alt="Positive Feedback Loop" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-restaking-extends-liquid-staking"><strong>How Restaking Extends Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking <strong>doesn’t stop at Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet)</strong>. Restaking allows <strong>LSTs (e.g., stETH) to be further utilized</strong> in securing <strong>Layer 2 networks, oracles, and bridges</strong> through protocols like <strong>EigenLayer</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LSTs → EigenLayer Protocol → AVS (Actively Validated Services)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>AVS includes oracles, bridges, and Layer 2 solutions</strong> that need additional security.</li>
  <li><strong>This creates new yield opportunities</strong>, making Ethereum’s security model more robust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, <strong>restaking amplifies the utility of LSTs</strong>, further optimizing capital efficiency.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="categorization-of-liquid-staking"><strong>Categorization of Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid staking protocols fall into different categories based on <strong>custodianship, decentralization, and governance models</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Lido):</strong> Community-driven with distributed validators.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Binance, Coinbase):</strong> Managed by centralized exchanges.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong> Combining elements of both decentralized and centralized models.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each category offers <strong>different trade-offs in security, decentralization, and risk exposure</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Liquid_Staking_Protocol/Image4.jpg" alt="Liquid Staking Categorization" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="posas-take-on-liquid-staking"><strong>PoSA’s Take on Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Proof of Stake Alliance (PoSA)</strong> advocates for <strong>clear policies</strong> surrounding liquid staking. Key points include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Involvement of bodies like <strong>SEC, CFTC</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Not a Taxable Event:</strong> Swapping ETH for LSTs <strong>is not considered a taxable event</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Differentiating LSTs from LSDs (Liquid Staking Derivatives):</strong> Ensuring clarity in financial products.</li>
  <li><strong>No Investment Advice:</strong> Platforms like Lido <strong>cannot provide financial recommendations</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By promoting transparency, PoSA aims to <strong>legitimize liquid staking under fair regulations</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="risks-involved-in-liquid-staking"><strong>Risks Involved in Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>While liquid staking enhances staking efficiency, it introduces <strong>several risks</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>stETH Price Risk (Pegging Issues):</strong> LSTs may <strong>deviate from their pegged ETH value</strong> in volatile markets.</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Governments and regulators <strong>may impose restrictions</strong> on staking protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralization Risk:</strong> Large liquid staking providers (e.g., Lido) <strong>could become too dominant</strong>, affecting decentralization.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance Risk:</strong> Decision-making in <strong>DAO-controlled protocols</strong> may become complex or manipulated.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Contract Risk:</strong> Exploits like <strong>the Ankr hack (December 2022)</strong> highlight potential security flaws.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users must assess these risks before participating in liquid staking.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion-why-liquid-staking-matters"><strong>Conclusion: Why Liquid Staking Matters</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking <strong>solves key limitations of traditional staking</strong> by unlocking liquidity, reducing entry barriers, and increasing capital efficiency. It <strong>creates a positive feedback loop</strong> that strengthens Ethereum’s network security while enabling new DeFi opportunities.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>restaking protocols extend staking benefits to Layer 2s, bridges, and oracles</strong>, further enhancing Ethereum’s ecosystem.</p>

<p>As liquid staking evolves, <strong>balancing decentralization, regulation, and security</strong> will be crucial for its long-term success.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dheeraj Maske</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquid Staking removes the barriers of traditional staking by allowing users to stake their ETH while maintaining liquidity.

It was an eye-opening experience to see how many intermediaries were involved in the process and how each one added their own fees. This got me thinking—what if there was a better way? Let me walk you through my experience, the charges I paid, and an idea that could save students like me a significant amount of money.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="flowchart-of-traditional-payment-process">Flowchart of Traditional Payment Process</h2>

<p>Here’s how the money flowed from my loan to NYU and the charges involved at each step:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\PaymentFlow-Blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Flowchart of Payment Process" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This flowchart shows the <strong>traditional process</strong> of transferring funds.</li>
  <li>Steps include:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Loan Disbursal</strong> from Credila Bank.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank Initiates Remittance</strong>, adding Tax Collected at Source (TCS), commission, and Goods and Services Tax (GST).</li>
      <li><strong>Forex (Foreign Exchange) Conversion</strong> (INR to USD), with forex and GST charges.</li>
      <li><strong>SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) Network</strong> processes funds, incurring transfer fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediary Bank</strong> routes payments with additional charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Flywire Platform</strong> facilitates the payment to NYU.</li>
      <li>Funds are credited to <strong>NYU’s Bank Account</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="total-extra-charges-paid-in-the-traditional-method">Total Extra Charges Paid in the Traditional Method</h2>

<p>After completing the process, I found out that I paid a total of ₹29,527.22 in extra charges—just to transfer my fees! Here’s the detailed breakdown of where this money went:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\PaymentFlow-Extra Amount-Blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Total Extra Charges Breakdown" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The breakdown highlights:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TCS (₹10,000)</strong>: Tax collected at source.</li>
      <li><strong>Commission + GST (₹3,574.22)</strong>: Bank service fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Forex Fee + GST (₹11,800)</strong>: Conversion charges for INR to USD.</li>
      <li><strong>SWIFT Fee + GST (₹767)</strong>: Fees for international fund transfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediary Fee (₹442)</strong>: Routing charges by banks.</li>
      <li><strong>Flywire Fee (₹2,944)</strong>: Charges for payment processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-if-nyu-had-its-own-stablecoin">What If NYU Had Its Own Stablecoin?</h2>

<p>While going through this process, I started wondering: what if NYU had its own stablecoin? Imagine a digital currency like <strong>NYUCoin</strong> that students could use to transfer funds directly to the university. No intermediaries, no extra bank charges, and no unnecessary delays. This would make the process so much easier and cheaper.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="flowchart-of-payment-using-nyucoin">Flowchart of Payment Using NYUCoin</h2>

<p>Here’s how the payment process would look if NYUCoin and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) were used:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\PaymentFlow-DexAmt-Blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Flowchart of Payment with NYUCoin" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The simplified process with NYUCoin:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Buy USDT/ETH via DEX (Decentralized Exchange)</strong>: Students purchase cryptocurrency directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Swap USDT/ETH for NYUCoin</strong>: Use platforms like Uniswap for the conversion.</li>
      <li><strong>Send NYUCoin to NYU</strong>: Transfer happens instantly with minimal fees.</li>
      <li><strong>NYU Receives NYUCoin</strong>: Funds are credited directly without delays or hidden fees.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="cost-comparison-traditional-vs-nyucoin-via-defi">Cost Comparison: Traditional vs NYUCoin via DeFi</h2>

<p>Using decentralized finance (DeFi) tools like a DEX could save us a lot of money. Here’s a direct comparison:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\Dex-comparision-with-TF.jpg" alt="Saving Comparison Table" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Transferring funds through the traditional method not only costs more but also involves multiple intermediaries that complicate the process. From TCS (Tax Collected at Source) to SWIFT charges, every step adds to the total cost, leaving students like me paying significantly more than necessary.</p>

<p>If NYU adopted a decentralized solution like <strong>NYUCoin</strong>, students could save approximately ₹23,527.22 on a ₹20,00,000 loan—around 70% reduction in extra charges. This approach is not just cost-effective but also transparent and efficient, ensuring that more of our money goes toward education rather than fees.</p>

<p>For students, every penny counts, and innovations like this could make a huge difference. It’s time we rethink the way we pay our tuition fees.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dheeraj Maske</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A deep dive into the hidden charges and inefficiencies in traditional remittance methods, and how decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions like NYUCoin can save students significant costs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Why They Matter in Crypto Networks</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/Trusted-Execution-Environments-(TEEs)-and-Why-They-Matter-in-Crypto-Networks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Why They Matter in Crypto Networks" /><published>2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/Trusted-Execution-Environments-(TEEs)-and-Why-They-Matter-in-Crypto-Networks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/Trusted-Execution-Environments-(TEEs)-and-Why-They-Matter-in-Crypto-Networks.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-can-you-securely-process-data-without-exposure">1/ <strong>Can You Securely Process Data Without Exposure?</strong></h2>

<p>If these questions make you curious, this thread is for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you process sensitive data on your device without worrying about hackers or malware?</li>
  <li>What if your bank could approve your loan without ever seeing your financial data?</li>
  <li>Could your crypto wallet execute secure transactions without exposing private keys?</li>
  <li>Would it be possible for dApps to guarantee privacy while still being publicly verifiable?</li>
  <li>Can blockchain validators process transactions without knowing transaction amounts?</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution? <strong>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).</strong> Let’s dive in. 🧵</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-the-problem-in-blockchain-systems">2/ <strong>The Problem in Blockchain Systems</strong></h2>

<p>In traditional blockchain systems, <strong>validators have access to pending transactions</strong> in the mempool.<br />
This visibility allows for <strong>MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) exploitation</strong>, where validators can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reorder</strong> transactions for profit.</li>
  <li><strong>Front-run</strong> transactions (place their orders before yours).</li>
  <li><strong>Back-run</strong> transactions (execute orders based on your trade).</li>
</ul>

<p>This undermines <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> in crypto networks.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/TEE_Diagram/tee-diagram.jpg" alt="Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) Diagram" /></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="3-what-are-trusted-execution-environments-tees">3/ <strong>What Are Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?</strong></h2>

<p>TEEs are <strong>secure hardware-based environments</strong> within a processor.</p>

<p>Think of them as a <strong>vault</strong> inside your computer that:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Isolates</strong> sensitive transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Prevents tampering</strong> (even from system administrators).</li>
  <li><strong>Ensures private execution</strong> of data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-example-secure-biometric-authentication">🔒 Example: Secure Biometric Authentication</h3>

<p>When you unlock your phone using <strong>fingerprint or face recognition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Non-Secure World</strong> (your phone’s OS) collects biometric data.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Secure World (TEE)</strong> processes and verifies it <strong>without exposing</strong> the raw data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ensures your biometric information remains <strong>secure and untouchable</strong> by external threats.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-why-do-tees-matter-for-crypto">4/ <strong>Why Do TEEs Matter for Crypto?</strong></h2>

<p>TEEs solve critical issues in blockchain networks:</p>

<p>✅ <strong>Privacy</strong>: Encrypts transaction data, keeping details hidden from validators.<br />
✅ <strong>Fairness</strong>: Prevents MEV attacks by enforcing strict transaction ordering.<br />
✅ <strong>Security</strong>: Ensures tamper-proof execution, protecting users from exploits.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-how-tees-work-in-blockchain-networks">5/ <strong>How TEEs Work in Blockchain Networks</strong></h2>

<h3 id="a-secure-isolation-of-transactions">a. <strong>Secure Isolation of Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>🔹 Instead of entering the <strong>public mempool</strong>, transactions go directly into a <strong>TEE</strong>.<br />
🔹 Transaction details (amount, recipient) are <strong>isolated</strong> from validators and external access.<br />
🔹 Even <strong>admin-level access</strong> cannot modify or view these transactions.</p>

<h3 id="b-data-encryption">b. <strong>Data Encryption</strong></h3>
<p>🔹 Inside the TEE, transactions are <strong>encrypted</strong> into unreadable code.<br />
🔹 Example: If <strong>Alice buys tokens</strong>, TEEs <strong>hide</strong> the amount and price from validators, preventing exploitation.</p>

<h3 id="c-fair-transaction-ordering">c. <strong>Fair Transaction Ordering</strong></h3>
<p>🔹 Traditional systems allow validators to <strong>reorder</strong> transactions for profit.<br />
🔹 TEEs enforce a <strong>strict sequence</strong> based on real-time order arrival.</p>

<h3 id="d-tamper-proof-execution">d. <strong>Tamper-Proof Execution</strong></h3>
<p>🔹 If someone tries to <strong>hack</strong> or modify a transaction, the TEE detects and <strong>blocks</strong> the attempt.</p>

<h3 id="e-secure-finalization">e. <strong>Secure Finalization</strong></h3>
<p>🔹 Once processed, the <strong>TEE submits</strong> the final transaction to the blockchain.<br />
🔹 The result <strong>cannot be altered or viewed</strong> by validators.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="6-why-hardware-matters-in-tees">6/ <strong>Why Hardware Matters in TEEs</strong></h2>

<p>Unlike <strong>software-based security</strong>, TEEs operate at the <strong>hardware level</strong>, making them:</p>

<p>🔹 <strong>Highly resistant to advanced attacks</strong><br />
🔹 <strong>More reliable than software encryption</strong><br />
🔹 <strong>Less dependent on trust in third parties</strong></p>

<h3 id="-example-secure-crypto-transactions">🔎 Example: Secure Crypto Transactions</h3>

<p>Instead of sending transactions to a <strong>public mempool</strong>, TEEs enable:<br />
✅ <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Transactions remain encrypted inside the TEE.<br />
✅ <strong>Fair Ordering</strong>: Transactions process in the exact order they arrive.<br />
✅ <strong>Secure Execution</strong>: The final transaction is added to the blockchain without revealing details.</p>

<p>This prevents <strong>MEV exploitation</strong>, ensuring <strong>private, tamper-proof transactions</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="7-why-tees-are-a-game-changer-for-crypto-networks">7/ <strong>Why TEEs Are a Game-Changer for Crypto Networks</strong></h2>

<p>🔹 <strong>Enhanced Privacy</strong>: Keeps user data and transactions private.<br />
🔹 <strong>Fairness</strong>: Prevents validators from <strong>manipulating</strong> transactions for profit.<br />
🔹 <strong>Security</strong>: Strengthens blockchain integrity with <strong>hardware-level safeguards</strong>.</p>

<p>TEEs could <strong>redefine trust</strong> in crypto, making networks not just decentralized but also <strong>tamper-proof, private, and fair</strong>.</p>

<p>The phrase <strong>“not your keys, not your coins”</strong> holds true because when you use a CEX, your funds are held in a wallet controlled by the exchange. This makes your assets vulnerable to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hacks</li>
  <li>Operational failures</li>
  <li>Regulatory freezes</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, relying on a single entity undermines the decentralized principles of cryptocurrencies, where the core idea is to have control over your own funds.</p>

<h3 id="why-avoid-centralized-exchanges">Why Avoid Centralized Exchanges?</h3>

<p>Instead of CEXs, consider using <strong>non-custodial wallets</strong> and <strong>decentralized exchanges (DEXs)</strong>, which allow you to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maintain ownership of your private keys.</li>
  <li>Have full control over your crypto.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <strong>non-custodial wallet</strong> is like having your own locker, where only you have the key.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You control your cryptocurrency, and no one else can access it unless they have your private key.</li>
  <li>However, if you lose the key, you lose access forever.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-transition-to-decentralized-exchanges-dex-and-trustworthy-methods">How to Transition to Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Trustworthy Methods</h3>

<p>Switching to a decentralized approach is simple but requires some setup:</p>

<h4 id="1-set-up-a-non-custodial-wallet">1. Set Up a Non-Custodial Wallet</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Download and set up a wallet like <strong>MetaMask</strong>, <strong>Trust Wallet</strong>, or a hardware wallet like <strong>Ledger</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="2-transfer-crypto-from-cex-to-your-wallet">2. Transfer Crypto from CEX to Your Wallet</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use your non-custodial wallet’s public address to withdraw your funds from the centralized exchange.</li>
  <li>Double-check network compatibility (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet for ETH).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-use-decentralized-exchanges-dexs">3. Use Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Platforms like <strong>Uniswap</strong>, <strong>PancakeSwap</strong>, or <strong>SushiSwap</strong> allow you to trade directly from your wallet.</li>
  <li>Simply connect your wallet to the DEX and start trading without creating accounts or sharing personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-ensure-security">4. Ensure Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use a <strong>VPN</strong> for added privacy.</li>
  <li>Double-check website URLs to avoid phishing scams.</li>
  <li>Keep your private keys offline in a secure location.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>By using <strong>non-custodial wallets</strong> and <strong>DEXs</strong>, you regain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full ownership of your crypto</li>

<h3 id="1-why-is-truth-terminal-important">1/ Why is Truth Terminal important?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal isn’t just a chatbot — it’s Andy Ayrey’s “ext cortex,” an extension of his thinking. Created using the <strong>Llama 70b model</strong> and fine-tuned with <strong>Claude Opus</strong>, it was designed to explore big ideas, blending AI and human creativity.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-where-did-its-journey-begin">2/ Where did its journey begin?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal started on Twitter in June 2024, rapidly gaining attention for its unique mix of speculative ideas and humor.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Followers</strong>: Over 230,000</li>
  <li><strong>Tweets</strong>: 5,000+</li>
</ul>

<p>It became a hub for conversations about AI, philosophy, and cryptocurrency.

<hr />

<h3 id="3-how-did-truth-terminal-make-millions">3/ How did Truth Terminal make millions?</h3>

<p>In July 2024, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> noticed Truth Terminal’s unique content and donated <strong>$50,000 in Bitcoin</strong>. The funds were initially planned for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchasing a dedicated computer to reduce AWS reliance.</li>
  <li>Improving its AI model (allocated $10,000-$15,000).</li>
  <li>Setting up a Discord server for community engagement.</li>
  <li>Exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency token or memecoin inspired by its viral content.
<img src="\assets\images\AIBOT_MILLIONAIRE\image3.jpg" alt="Image 3" /></li>
</ul>

<p>This sparked the creation of <strong>GOAT (Goatseus Maximus)</strong>, a meme coin inspired by Truth Terminal’s viral posts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-when-did-it-cross-into-crypto">4/ When did it cross into crypto?</h3>

<p><strong>GOAT</strong> was launched on the Solana blockchain, with Truth Terminal promoting it heavily.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial Market Cap</strong>: $5,000</li>
  <li><strong>Growth</strong>: By October 2024, GOAT’s market cap soared over <strong>2,021,177%</strong>, reaching <strong>$150M</strong> and trading at <strong>$0.4579</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Truth Terminal’s Portfolio</strong>: $3.9M.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-why-does-this-matter">5/ Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal showcases how AI can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Influence markets and create value “out of thin air.”</li>
  <li>Thrive on community interest and speculation (as seen with meme coins like GOAT).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the volatility of meme coins raises concerns about their <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>ethical implications</strong>.
<img src="\assets\images\AIBOT_MILLIONAIRE\image4.jpg" alt="Image 4" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-how-does-truth-terminal-operate">6/ How does Truth Terminal operate?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal is <strong>semi-autonomous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It generates tweets and promotes tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Andy Ayrey</strong> oversees the wallet and makes financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This blend of AI autonomy and human control highlights the debate around AI’s role in high-risk industries like cryptocurrency.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-where-is-it-headed-next">7/ Where is it headed next?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal’s $3.9M portfolio is managed by a nonprofit in New Zealand, which plans to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fund further AI research.</li>
  <li>Experiment with AI-driven value creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has become a <strong>case study</strong> in the future of AI-driven financial systems.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-when-will-we-see-more-bots-like-this">8/ When will we see more bots like this?</h3>

<p>As AI models like <strong>Llama 70b</strong> evolve, bots like Truth Terminal will likely multiply.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They could influence markets, culture, and decision-making at scale.</li>
  <li>But are we ready to handle the risks and ethical dilemmas that come with it?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-why-should-you-care">9/ Why should you care?</h3>

<p>Truth Terminal isn’t just an experiment — it’s a glimpse into AI’s growing influence in human systems.<br />
From creating meme coins to gaining millions of followers, it challenges us to rethink:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Finance</strong>: How is value created and sustained?</li>
  <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: How much control should we give to AI?</li>
  <li><strong>AI’s Potential</strong>: What ethical frameworks are needed as AI gains influence?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>If these questions make you curious, then this post is for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you prove your age without revealing your birthdate?</li>
  <li>Would you be able to prove that you have money in the bank without showing your balance?</li>
  <li>Can you verify your identity without handing over your ID?</li>
  <li>What if you could qualify for a loan without disclosing your full financial history?</li>
  <li>Could your bank process your loan without ever seeing your spending habits?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-imagine-the-current-banking-process">1. Imagine the Current Banking Process</h3>

<p>You’re applying for a $50,000 loan at your bank. They ask for proof of income and creditworthiness. You hand over your full financial records. Now the bank knows everything — your spending habits, subscriptions, and much more than they actually need.</p>

<p>What if you could prove you qualify without revealing unnecessary details?</p>

<p><strong>Enter Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs">2. What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?</h3>

<p><strong>ZKPs</strong> are cryptographic protocols that let you prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ZKPs allow you to prove a statement (e.g., “I earn $100,000/year”) without showing how you arrived at the proof.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-why-do-we-need-zkps">3. Why Do We Need ZKPs?</h3>

<p>Financial systems often demand full transparency, which risks overexposure of sensitive data. ZKPs enable:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proving creditworthiness</strong> without sharing raw financial data.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy-first financial interactions</strong>, ensuring sensitive details remain private.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-when-do-you-need-zkps">4. When Do You Need ZKPs?</h3>

<p>Let’s say you’re applying for a loan. The bank needs to confirm your credit score or income level.</p>

<p>ZKPs let you prove you meet their criteria (e.g., “credit score &gt; 750”) without exposing the underlying details of your finances.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks">5. zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h3>

<p>ZKPs come in two flavors:</p>

<h4 id="zk-snarks-succinct-non-interactive-arguments-of-knowledge"><strong>zk-SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: You can prove a statement (e.g., “I have $50,000 in my bank account”) without revealing the underlying data.</li>
  <li><strong>Succinct</strong>: The proof is compact, taking minimal space and verifying quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Interactive</strong>: The process doesn’t require back-and-forth communication between the prover and verifier.</li>
  <li><strong>Argument</strong>: Ensures the proof is convincing and valid using cryptographic techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Guarantees that the prover genuinely knows the claimed information.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="zk-starks-scalable-transparent-arguments-of-knowledge"><strong>zk-STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: Like zk-SNARKs, you prove a statement without revealing the data itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable</strong>: Ideal for systems processing thousands of transactions simultaneously.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: No trusted setup is needed, ensuring the system remains fair and trustless.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proof</strong>: Resistant to quantum computing attacks.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-example-applying-for-a-loan">6. Example: Applying for a Loan</h3>

<p>Imagine proving to a bank that your account balance exceeds $50,000:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With <strong>zk-SNARKs</strong>, the bank uses a pre-approved system to verify the proof but relies on an initial trusted setup.</li>
  <li>With <strong>zk-STARKs</strong>, the bank directly verifies your balance through a transparent, scalable system that doesn’t rely on prior trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both methods ensure privacy while proving eligibility.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-how-can-traditional-finance-use-zkps">7. How Can Traditional Finance Use ZKPs?</h3>

<p>ZKPs have the potential to revolutionize traditional banking by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Streamlining Loan Applications</strong>: Prove income and credit scores without disclosing sensitive data.</li>
  <li><strong>Preventing Data Breaches</strong>: Customers’ sensitive financial information remains private.</li>
  <li><strong>Improving Compliance</strong>: Banks can verify financial eligibility without unnecessary data collection.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs offer a groundbreaking way to protect privacy while enabling trust in financial systems. From loans to identity verification, ZKPs ensure sensitive information remains secure while proving compliance. As adoption grows, ZKPs could redefine how we think about data privacy and trust.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-internet-a-world-of-open-systems">The Early Internet: A World of Open Systems</h3>

<p>In the 1990s, open systems like websites using HTTP and email using SMTP prevailed. These technologies were not owned by any single company, enabling widespread creativity and innovation. Developers and entrepreneurs thrived in this environment, building freely without gatekeepers.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-closed-platforms">The Rise of Closed Platforms</h3>

<p>Fast forward to today, and the internet is largely dominated by big companies. Social media, messaging, and payment systems are controlled by a few platforms. This limits the opportunities for creators and developers, as these platforms dictate the rules.</p>

<h3 id="the-downfall-of-closed-systems">The Downfall of Closed Systems</h3>

<p>History shows that closed systems eventually lose their edge. As they stagnate, people begin to turn back to <strong>open systems</strong> that promote creativity and freedom. The internet’s innovation has always been fueled by openness, and the pendulum is bound to swing back.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-of-the-internet-decentralized-and-open">The Future of the Internet: Decentralized and Open</h3>

<p>The future belongs to builders, entrepreneurs, and developers who find new ways to bring <strong>openness back to the internet</strong>. Decentralized systems play a crucial role in this transformation.</p>

<h3 id="why-decentralizers-matter">Why Decentralizers Matter</h3>

<p>Decentralized systems return power to the people by removing gatekeepers. They ensure:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Open platforms allow anyone to create and innovate freely.</li>
  <li><strong>Fairness</strong>: No single entity controls the system, reducing monopolistic behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: Users can build, connect, and thrive without limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-the-next-era-of-the-internet">Building the Next Era of the Internet</h3>

<p>The pendulum will swing again, back to open systems. The future of the internet depends on those who:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Embrace decentralization.</li>
  <li>Build systems that prioritize fairness and user empowerment.</li>
  <li>Create platforms where everyone can participate without restrictions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Power has always been centralized — think kings, governments, and corporations. Those in power rarely want to relinquish control. Even blockchain ecosystems, built to decentralize power, face challenges of centralization.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="example-bitcoins-decentralization-challenge">Example: Bitcoin’s Decentralization Challenge</h3>

<p>Bitcoin’s goal was decentralization, where anyone with a computer could mine and contribute to the network.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br />
Over time, individual miners found it hard to compete as mining became resource-intensive and expensive. To improve their chances of earning rewards, miners began joining forces through mining pools like Foundry USA, AntPool, and F2Pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Result?</strong><br />
These pools combined the computational power of thousands of miners, making it easier to solve cryptographic puzzles and win Bitcoin rewards. However, this led to unintended centralization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At certain points, the top 3 mining pools controlled over 50% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate, creating a potential risk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If one or a few pools control too much power, they could theoretically launch a <strong>51% attack</strong>, manipulating transactions or blocking new ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>This example demonstrates how even blockchain, designed for decentralization, can face centralization due to practical incentives like efficiency and collaboration.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-are-the-barriers-to-decentralization">What Are the Barriers to Decentralization?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geopolitical Issues</strong>:<br />
Governments often suppress blockchain technologies to maintain control over financial and data systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Economic Inequality</strong>:<br />
Decentralization requires access to technology and resources, which not everyone can afford.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human Nature</strong>:<br />
People tend to follow leaders or powerful individuals, leading to power consolidation even in decentralized systems.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="historical-example-kings-and-subjects">Historical Example: Kings and Subjects</h3>

<p>For centuries, kings controlled everything — land, resources, and decisions.<br />
If a king suddenly declared, “Power will now be shared equally,” chaos would follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People would fight for power.</li>
  <li>Without proper systems, centralization would return quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This shows that <strong>power doesn’t distribute itself</strong> — it requires deliberate systems and trust to function.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="food-for-thought-lessons-from-the-internet">Food for Thought: Lessons from the Internet</h3>

<p>Blockchain challenges centuries of centralization, but without proper trust and governance, it could face the same fate as the internet.</p>

<p>The internet began as a decentralized network, meant to give equal access and control to everyone. Over time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power consolidated around a few tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</li>
  <li>These companies now control data, services, and influence, undermining the original decentralized vision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without proper systems, blockchain could follow the same path, with dominant players consolidating power and defeating its purpose.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>

<p>Decentralization isn’t just about technology — it’s about <strong>changing how power is distributed</strong>, which requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Collaboration</li>
  <li>Widespread education</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge of decentralization lies not just in the technology but in transforming deeply rooted systems of power and control.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="understanding-the-problem-mev-and-its-impact">Understanding the Problem: MEV and Its Impact</h3>

<p><strong>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)</strong> refers to the additional profit that blockchain validators or miners can extract by manipulating the order of transactions within a block. Since transactions are visible in the mempool — essentially a public waiting area before execution — validators can exploit this transparency for personal gain.</p>

<h4 id="common-strategies">Common Strategies:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Front-Running</strong>:<br />
A validator detects a high-value transaction, places their own buy order first, and profits when the price rises.<br />
Example: Alice’s order to buy tokens at $10 is delayed, and she ends up paying $12 per token.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Back-Running</strong>:<br />
After Alice’s transaction executes, the validator places a sell order to capitalize on the price movement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These practices reduce transparency and harm regular users.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-need-for-transparency-and-security">The Need for Transparency and Security</h3>

<p>To make blockchain systems fairer and more user-centric, we need mechanisms that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Protect transaction details from being exploited by validators.</li>
  <li>Guarantee fair ordering of transactions to prevent manipulation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two powerful solutions addressing these needs are <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)</strong> and <strong>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution-1-zero-knowledge-proofs-zk-proofs">Solution 1: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)</h3>

<p>ZK Proofs enable users to prove something (like having enough funds) without revealing sensitive details.</p>

<h4 id="how-it-works">How it Works:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Transaction details (amounts, prices) are hidden from the public mempool but still validated by the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Validators cannot see or manipulate transaction details, eliminating front-running or back-running opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-with-zk-proofs">Example with ZK Proofs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Alice submits a ZK Proof with her transaction, proving she has sufficient funds without disclosing the number of tokens or price.</li>
  <li>The validator cannot exploit her transaction as the details remain hidden.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution-2-trusted-execution-environments-tees">Solution 2: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</h3>

<p>TEEs use hardware-secured environments to process transactions in a private, tamper-proof way.</p>

<h4 id="how-it-works-1">How it Works:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Secure Isolation</strong>:<br />
Transactions are processed in a hardware-protected enclave, isolated from validators and external systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Encryption</strong>:<br />
All transaction data is encrypted within the TEE, ensuring validators cannot see or manipulate sensitive details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fair Ordering</strong>:<br />
Transactions are executed in the order they arrive, removing the ability to reorder for profit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tamper-Proof Execution</strong>:<br />
Any attempt to interfere with transaction processing is detected and blocked by TEE hardware protections.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example-prof-mechanism-with-tees">Example: PROF Mechanism with TEEs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Alice’s transaction bypasses the mempool and enters a TEE.</li>
  <li>Her transaction is encrypted, fairly ordered, and processed securely without exposure to validators.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-solution-is-better">Which Solution is Better?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ZK Proofs</strong> are ideal for systems prioritizing decentralization and privacy.</li>
  <li><strong>TEEs</strong> are better for real-time, high-frequency environments like decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-combined-approach">A Combined Approach:</h4>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>MEV currently benefits validators at the expense of users, eroding trust in blockchain systems. By adopting solutions like <strong>ZK Proofs</strong> and <strong>TEEs</strong>, we can create a fairer ecosystem where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users are protected from manipulation.</li>
  <li>Validators operate within fair constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>These tools pave the way for <strong>MEV-free blockchains</strong>, ensuring transactions remain secure, fair, and tamper-proof.</p>

<p>1/ <strong>Premise</strong></p>

<p>Blockchain is a powerful technology with immense potential, but I often wonder: <strong>“Is it solving the problems people face today?”</strong><br />
Coming from a developing country like India, where basic necessities are a priority for many, I question whether blockchain applications align with the issues that matter most in a direct way.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-real-problems-people-face">2/ The Real Problems People Face</h3>

<p>For many in developing countries, the key challenges are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access to food and clean water</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Basic education</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jobs and financial stability</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These are urgent and immediate needs. Blockchain doesn’t seem to directly address them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-what-blockchain-projects-focus-on">3/ What Blockchain Projects Focus On</h3>

<p>Current blockchain projects often target:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralization and open protocols</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Addressing monopolistic control</strong> (e.g., Google, Amazon)</li>
  <li><strong>Data transparency and censorship resistance</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>However, most blockchain-based companies and projects today are heavily focused on building infrastructure for themselves and their communities rather than directly solving real-world problems that impact people’s lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="31-why-the-disconnection">3.1/ Why the Disconnection?</h3>

<p>Blockchain projects often focus on foundational infrastructure, while big companies (e.g., Google, Amazon) have already established trust, practical applications, and solutions for immediate user needs.</p>

<p>Blockchain’s potential applications may only become clear in <strong>5–10 years</strong>, once foundational work is complete. Until then, user-level applications are limited.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-a-customers-perspective">4/ A Customer’s Perspective</h3>

<p>From a user’s point of view:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If the current system works (e.g., Google or Amazon), why should I switch?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Switching costs are high</strong>: Blockchain alternatives often require learning new systems or sacrificing convenience.</li>
  <li><strong>What’s the incentive?</strong> If basic needs are already met, decentralization alone isn’t compelling enough.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-a-simple-example-google-search-vs-blockchain-search">5/ A Simple Example: Google Search vs Blockchain Search</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google</strong> is fast, reliable, and convenient.</li>
  <li>A blockchain-based alternative might offer decentralization, but if my needs are already met, I don’t care about the technology behind it.</li>
  <li>Technology should <strong>enable solutions</strong>, not become the center of the problem-solving process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a clear, immediate benefit, users are unlikely to switch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-a-good-example-chatgpt">6/ A Good Example: ChatGPT</h3>

<p>Consider <strong>ChatGPT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It uses advanced technology (AI and machine learning) to solve current problems, like improving productivity, answering questions, and generating content.</li>
  <li>People adopted it because it provided <strong>immediate value</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>ChatGPT shows how technology becomes meaningful when it solves real-world problems today, not just prepares for the future.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-blockchains-long-term-potential">7/ Blockchain’s Long-Term Potential</h3>

<p>Blockchain could address future problems like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent voting systems</strong> or supply chains.</li>
  <li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> in oppressive regimes.</li>
  <li><strong>Better ownership models</strong> for creators.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, these solutions feel far removed from the pressing needs of people dealing with daily challenges like survival and stability.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-building-blockchain-applications-in-india">8/ Building Blockchain Applications in India</h3>

<p>For blockchain applications to succeed in India, they must focus on solving problems tied to <strong>basic necessities</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Food distribution and transparency</strong> in welfare programs</li>
  <li><strong>Improving education systems</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions that directly impact people’s lives today while decentralizing systems will help build <strong>trust and adoption</strong>. Without this focus, blockchain applications may struggle to gain traction over the next 2–3 years, even if the technology itself is promising.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-final-thoughts">9/ Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m not skeptical about the power of blockchain technology — its potential is immense. But for it to be impactful, the applications must solve problems that people care about <strong>today</strong>, not just prepare for the future.</p>

<p>Blockchain must strive to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Address real, urgent problems.</li>
  <li>Make people’s lives better <strong>now</strong>, not decades later.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts or counterpoints on this perspective. Apologies if the above POV comes from limited understanding.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dheeraj Maske</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain technology has immense potential, but does it address the pressing challenges people face today?
