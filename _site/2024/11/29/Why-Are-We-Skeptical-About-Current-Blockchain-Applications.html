<p>1/ <strong>Premise</strong></p>

<p>Blockchain is a powerful technology with immense potential, but I often wonder: <strong>“Is it solving the problems people face today?”</strong><br />
Coming from a developing country like India, where basic necessities are a priority for many, I question whether blockchain applications align with the issues that matter most in a direct way.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-real-problems-people-face">2/ The Real Problems People Face</h3>

<p>For many in developing countries, the key challenges are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access to food and clean water</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Basic education</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jobs and financial stability</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These are urgent and immediate needs. Blockchain doesn’t seem to directly address them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-what-blockchain-projects-focus-on">3/ What Blockchain Projects Focus On</h3>

<p>Current blockchain projects often target:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralization and open protocols</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Addressing monopolistic control</strong> (e.g., Google, Amazon)</li>
  <li><strong>Data transparency and censorship resistance</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>However, most blockchain-based companies and projects today are heavily focused on building infrastructure for themselves and their communities rather than directly solving real-world problems that impact people’s lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="31-why-the-disconnection">3.1/ Why the Disconnection?</h3>

<p>Blockchain projects often focus on foundational infrastructure, while big companies (e.g., Google, Amazon) have already established trust, practical applications, and solutions for immediate user needs.</p>

<p>Blockchain’s potential applications may only become clear in <strong>5–10 years</strong>, once foundational work is complete. Until then, user-level applications are limited.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-a-customers-perspective">4/ A Customer’s Perspective</h3>

<p>From a user’s point of view:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If the current system works (e.g., Google or Amazon), why should I switch?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Switching costs are high</strong>: Blockchain alternatives often require learning new systems or sacrificing convenience.</li>
  <li><strong>What’s the incentive?</strong> If basic needs are already met, decentralization alone isn’t compelling enough.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-a-simple-example-google-search-vs-blockchain-search">5/ A Simple Example: Google Search vs Blockchain Search</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google</strong> is fast, reliable, and convenient.</li>
  <li>A blockchain-based alternative might offer decentralization, but if my needs are already met, I don’t care about the technology behind it.</li>
  <li>Technology should <strong>enable solutions</strong>, not become the center of the problem-solving process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a clear, immediate benefit, users are unlikely to switch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-a-good-example-chatgpt">6/ A Good Example: ChatGPT</h3>

<p>Consider <strong>ChatGPT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It uses advanced technology (AI and machine learning) to solve current problems, like improving productivity, answering questions, and generating content.</li>
  <li>People adopted it because it provided <strong>immediate value</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>ChatGPT shows how technology becomes meaningful when it solves real-world problems today, not just prepares for the future.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-blockchains-long-term-potential">7/ Blockchain’s Long-Term Potential</h3>

<p>Blockchain could address future problems like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent voting systems</strong> or supply chains.</li>
  <li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> in oppressive regimes.</li>
  <li><strong>Better ownership models</strong> for creators.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, these solutions feel far removed from the pressing needs of people dealing with daily challenges like survival and stability.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-building-blockchain-applications-in-india">8/ Building Blockchain Applications in India</h3>

<p>For blockchain applications to succeed in India, they must focus on solving problems tied to <strong>basic necessities</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Affordable healthcare</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Food distribution and transparency</strong> in welfare programs</li>
  <li><strong>Improving education systems</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions that directly impact people’s lives today while decentralizing systems will help build <strong>trust and adoption</strong>. Without this focus, blockchain applications may struggle to gain traction over the next 2–3 years, even if the technology itself is promising.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-final-thoughts">9/ Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m not skeptical about the power of blockchain technology — its potential is immense. But for it to be impactful, the applications must solve problems that people care about <strong>today</strong>, not just prepare for the future.</p>

<p>Blockchain must strive to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Address real, urgent problems.</li>
  <li>Make people’s lives better <strong>now</strong>, not decades later.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts or counterpoints on this perspective. Apologies if the above POV comes from limited understanding.</p>
