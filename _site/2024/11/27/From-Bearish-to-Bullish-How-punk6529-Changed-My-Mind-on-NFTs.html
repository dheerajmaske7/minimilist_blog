                <h3 id="1-questioning-nfts-">1/ Questioning NFTs 🤔</h3>

<p>I recently came across a thread by <a href="https://x.com/punk6529/status/1424127571663405060">@punk6529</a> that challenged my bearish views on NFTs. It explained why NFTs matter, how they solve real problems, and why their underlying myth — <strong>decentralization</strong> — is so powerful.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-the-power-of-myths">2/ The Power of Myths</h3>

<p>Humans thrive on myths — shared stories that allow us to cooperate and build systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Money</strong> is a myth: It works because we agree it has value.</li>
  <li><strong>Nations</strong> are myths: Flags and borders are stories we believe in.</li>
  <li><strong>Brands</strong> are myths: Think Apple, Nike, or even Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>

<p>These myths shape our reality and fuel human innovation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-bitcoin-a-modern-myth">3/ Bitcoin: A Modern Myth</h3>

<p>Bitcoin succeeded because of its myths:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: No single authority controls it.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Gold</strong>: A store of value in digital form.</li>
  <li><strong>HODL</strong>: A belief that holding Bitcoin will lead to future rewards.</li>
</ul>

<p>These myths created <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>adoption</strong>, and ultimately, <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-nfts-a-new-myth">4/ NFTs: A New Myth</h3>

<p>NFTs are the next evolution of myth-making. They allow us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn art into digital assets with <strong>provable ownership</strong>.</li>
  <li>Immortalize memes as cultural milestones.</li>
  <li>Build communities through <strong>shared ownership</strong> and incentives.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are myths for a digital, decentralized world.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-why-decentralization-matters">5/ Why Decentralization Matters</h3>

<p>NFTs are built on the same myth as Bitcoin: <strong>decentralization</strong>.<br />
This means no one owns the system, and individuals have the power to shape its value. It allows people to pick their own myths, rather than relying on institutions to impose them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="6-solving-real-problems">6/ Solving Real Problems</h3>

<p>NFTs are already solving problems for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artists</strong>: They can monetize directly, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like galleries or labels.</li>
  <li><strong>Creators</strong>: Memes and culture, once exploited for free, now generate value.</li>
  <li><strong>Communities</strong>: Ownership aligns incentives, building stronger, more invested tribes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ps-if-you-want-to-solve-problems-for-artists-or-creators-stay-bullish-on-nfts">PS: If you want to solve problems for artists or creators, stay bullish on NFTs.</h4>

<p>Take YouTube creators or independent bands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YouTube takes a significant cut of ad revenue, leaving creators underpaid.</li>
  <li>Musicians on platforms like Spotify earn pennies per stream.</li>
</ul>

<p>NFTs give creators <strong>direct access</strong> to their fans, fair royalties, and <strong>true ownership</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="7-the-risk-of-institutions">7/ The Risk of Institutions</h3>

<p>Here’s the risk: Institutions — masters of myth-making — might co-opt NFTs for centralization.</p>

<p>Look at streaming platforms like Spotify or YouTube. While they empower creators with reach, they <strong>control revenue and data</strong>, leaving creators with minimal rewards.</p>

<p>If institutions dominate NFTs, they could build new walled gardens, owning platforms and royalties while creators remain underpaid. Protecting the <strong>decentralized roots</strong> of NFTs is crucial to avoid this outcome.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="8-belief-comes-first">8/ Belief Comes First</h3>

<p>Here’s the kicker: First, you have to believe in a myth before it becomes reality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin wasn’t “digital gold” at the start — it became that because people believed in it.</li>
  <li>NFTs need belief to grow into tools that solve problems at scale.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="9-why-my-view-is-shifting">9/ Why My View Is Shifting</h3>

<p>Initially, I thought NFTs were just overhyped JPGs. Now, I see their potential to democratize art, culture, and value. They’re solving problems for artists, creators, and communities — and their story is just beginning.</p>
