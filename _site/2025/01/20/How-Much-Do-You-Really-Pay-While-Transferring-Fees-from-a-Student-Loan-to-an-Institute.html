            <h2>How Much Are You Really Losing to Hidden Fees When Paying Tuition Abroad by Traditional Banking?</h2>
            <p><small>Published on January 20, 2025</small></p>
            <div>
                <p>When I transferred funds from a loan of ₹20,00,000 to New York University (NYU) for my tuition fees, I realized how much extra I ended up paying in hidden charges. It was an eye-opening experience to see how many intermediaries were involved in the process and how each one added their own fees. This got me thinking—what if there was a better way? Let me walk you through my experience, the charges I paid, and an idea that could save students like me a significant amount of money.</p>

<h2 id="flowchart-of-traditional-payment-process">Flowchart of Traditional Payment Process</h2>

<p>Here’s how the money flowed from my loan to NYU and the charges involved at each step:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This flowchart shows the <strong>traditional process</strong> of transferring funds.</li>
  <li>Steps include:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Loan Disbursal</strong> from Credila Bank.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank Initiates Remittance</strong>, adding Tax Collected at Source (TCS), commission, and Goods and Services Tax (GST).</li>
      <li><strong>Forex (Foreign Exchange) Conversion</strong> (INR to USD), with forex and GST charges.</li>
      <li><strong>SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) Network</strong> processes funds, incurring transfer fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediary Bank</strong> routes payments with additional charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Flywire Platform</strong> facilitates the payment to NYU.</li>
      <li>Funds are credited to <strong>NYU’s Bank Account</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="total-extra-charges-paid-in-the-traditional-method">Total Extra Charges Paid in the Traditional Method</h2>

<p>After completing the process, I found out that I paid a total of ₹29,527.22 in extra charges—just to transfer my fees! Here’s the detailed breakdown of where this money went:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\PaymentFlow-Extra Amount-Blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Total Extra Charges Breakdown" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The breakdown highlights:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TCS (₹10,000)</strong>: Tax collected at source.</li>
      <li><strong>Commission + GST (₹3,574.22)</strong>: Bank service fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Forex Fee + GST (₹11,800)</strong>: Conversion charges for INR to USD.</li>
      <li><strong>SWIFT Fee + GST (₹767)</strong>: Fees for international fund transfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediary Fee (₹442)</strong>: Routing charges by banks.</li>
      <li><strong>Flywire Fee (₹2,944)</strong>: Charges for payment processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-if-nyu-had-its-own-stablecoin">What If NYU Had Its Own Stablecoin?</h2>

<p>While going through this process, I started wondering: what if NYU had its own stablecoin? Imagine a digital currency like <strong>NYUCoin</strong> that students could use to transfer funds directly to the university. No intermediaries, no extra bank charges, and no unnecessary delays. This would make the process so much easier and cheaper.</p>

<h2 id="flowchart-of-payment-using-nyucoin">Flowchart of Payment Using NYUCoin</h2>

<p>Here’s how the payment process would look if NYUCoin and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) were used:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\How_Much_Do_You_Really_Pay_While_Transferring_Fees_from_a_Student_Loan\PaymentFlow-DexAmt-Blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Flowchart of Payment with NYUCoin" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The simplified process with NYUCoin:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Buy USDT/ETH via DEX (Decentralized Exchange)</strong>: Students purchase cryptocurrency directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Swap USDT/ETH for NYUCoin</strong>: Use platforms like Uniswap for the conversion.</li>
      <li><strong>Send NYUCoin to NYU</strong>: Transfer happens instantly with minimal fees.</li>
      <li><strong>NYU Receives NYUCoin</strong>: Funds are credited directly without delays or hidden fees.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-comparison-traditional-vs-nyucoin-via-defi">Cost Comparison: Traditional vs NYUCoin via DeFi</h2>

<p>Using decentralized finance (DeFi) tools like a DEX could save us a lot of money. Here’s a direct comparison:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Transferring funds through the traditional method not only costs more but also involves multiple intermediaries that complicate the process. From TCS (Tax Collected at Source) to SWIFT charges, every step adds to the total cost, leaving students like me paying significantly more than necessary.</p>

<p>If NYU adopted a decentralized solution like <strong>NYUCoin</strong>, students could save approximately ₹23,527.22 on a ₹20,00,000 loan—around 70% reduction in extra charges. This approach is not just cost-effective but also transparent and efficient, ensuring that more of our money goes toward education rather than fees.</p>

<p>For students, every penny counts, and innovations like this could make a huge difference. It’s time we rethink the way we pay our tuition fees.</p>
