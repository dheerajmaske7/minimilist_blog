                <p>Thanks to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-grivol-782170201/?originalSubdomain=br">Gustavo</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/hanna-halaburda">Professor Hannah</a></strong> for the opportunity to speak at <strong><a href="https://blockchain.stern.nyu.edu/">Blockchain Lab NYU</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>With Ethereum’s transition from <strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong> in 2022, staking became the primary method of securing the network. However, traditional staking presented several challenges, such as <strong>liquidity lockups, high entry barriers, and exit restrictions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Liquid Staking</strong> emerged as a solution, allowing users to stake their assets while maintaining liquidity. This blog explores <strong>how liquid staking works, its benefits, and its relationship with restaking protocols</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-staking"><strong>The Problem with Traditional Staking</strong></h2>
<p>In the <strong>PoS model</strong>, validators secure the network by staking a fixed amount of ETH (e.g., <strong>32 ETH for Ethereum</strong>). Users, on the other hand, delegate their assets to validators. However, this traditional staking method comes with several limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Locked Assets:</strong> Once staked, assets become illiquid and unusable for other purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>High Entry Barriers:</strong> Becoming a validator requires a significant investment (~$75,000 for 32 ETH).</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Yield Opportunities:</strong> Users only earn the <strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong> from staking without additional yield generation.</li>
  <li><strong>Unstaking Delays &amp; Exit Restrictions:</strong> Withdrawals are subject to long waiting periods.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these issues, <strong>liquid staking protocols</strong> were introduced.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-liquid-staking"><strong>What is Liquid Staking?</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking allows users to stake their <strong>ETH without locking their assets</strong>. In return, they receive <strong>Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)</strong>, such as <strong>stETH (staked ETH) from Lido</strong>. These LSTs can be utilized in <strong>DeFi applications for lending, trading, and yield farming</strong>, all while continuing to earn staking rewards.</p>

<h3 id="how-liquid-staking-works"><strong>How Liquid Staking Works</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Users deposit ETH</strong> into a liquid staking protocol (e.g., Lido).</li>
  <li><strong>The protocol stakes ETH</strong> on behalf of the users by delegating to validators.</li>
  <li><strong>Users receive LSTs</strong> (e.g., stETH), representing their staked ETH.</li>
  <li><strong>LSTs remain tradable and usable in DeFi</strong>, ensuring liquidity while earning staking rewards.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-are-rewards-distributed"><strong>How Are Rewards Distributed?</strong></h2>
<p>Rewards from liquid staking are distributed <strong>proportionally</strong> based on the staked ETH and the performance of validators.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-positive-feedback-loop-of-liquid-staking"><strong>The Positive Feedback Loop of Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking creates a <strong>self-reinforcing cycle</strong> that strengthens Ethereum’s ecosystem:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>More Liquid Staking →</strong> Users can stake ETH while maintaining liquidity.</li>
  <li><strong>More Validators →</strong> Increased validator participation enhances decentralization.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower Transaction Costs →</strong> Higher competition among validators improves efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased ETH Demand →</strong> As staking becomes more accessible, demand for ETH rises.</li>
  <li><strong>More Staking →</strong> A larger percentage of ETH gets staked, securing the network further.</li>
  <li><strong>More Liquidity →</strong> The cycle continues, reinforcing Ethereum’s dominance.</li>
</ol>

<p>This continuous loop enhances <strong>network security and usability</strong>, making staking more accessible to all.</p>

<h2 id="how-restaking-extends-liquid-staking"><strong>How Restaking Extends Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking <strong>doesn’t stop at Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet)</strong>. Restaking allows <strong>LSTs (e.g., stETH) to be further utilized</strong> in securing <strong>Layer 2 networks, oracles, and bridges</strong> through protocols like <strong>EigenLayer</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LSTs → EigenLayer Protocol → AVS (Actively Validated Services)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>AVS includes oracles, bridges, and Layer 2 solutions</strong> that need additional security.</li>
  <li><strong>This creates new yield opportunities</strong>, making Ethereum’s security model more robust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, <strong>restaking amplifies the utility of LSTs</strong>, further optimizing capital efficiency.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="categorization-of-liquid-staking"><strong>Categorization of Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid staking protocols fall into different categories based on <strong>custodianship, decentralization, and governance models</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Lido):</strong> Community-driven with distributed validators.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralized Liquid Staking (e.g., Binance, Coinbase):</strong> Managed by centralized exchanges.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong> Combining elements of both decentralized and centralized models.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each category offers <strong>different trade-offs in security, decentralization, and risk exposure</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="posas-take-on-liquid-staking"><strong>PoSA’s Take on Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Proof of Stake Alliance (PoSA)</strong> advocates for <strong>clear policies</strong> surrounding liquid staking. Key points include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Involvement of bodies like <strong>SEC, CFTC</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Not a Taxable Event:</strong> Swapping ETH for LSTs <strong>is not considered a taxable event</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Differentiating LSTs from LSDs (Liquid Staking Derivatives):</strong> Ensuring clarity in financial products.</li>
  <li><strong>No Investment Advice:</strong> Platforms like Lido <strong>cannot provide financial recommendations</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By promoting transparency, PoSA aims to <strong>legitimize liquid staking under fair regulations</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="risks-involved-in-liquid-staking"><strong>Risks Involved in Liquid Staking</strong></h2>
<p>While liquid staking enhances staking efficiency, it introduces <strong>several risks</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>stETH Price Risk (Pegging Issues):</strong> LSTs may <strong>deviate from their pegged ETH value</strong> in volatile markets.</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Governments and regulators <strong>may impose restrictions</strong> on staking protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralization Risk:</strong> Large liquid staking providers (e.g., Lido) <strong>could become too dominant</strong>, affecting decentralization.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance Risk:</strong> Decision-making in <strong>DAO-controlled protocols</strong> may become complex or manipulated.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Contract Risk:</strong> Exploits like <strong>the Ankr hack (December 2022)</strong> highlight potential security flaws.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users must assess these risks before participating in liquid staking.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion-why-liquid-staking-matters"><strong>Conclusion: Why Liquid Staking Matters</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid Staking <strong>solves key limitations of traditional staking</strong> by unlocking liquidity, reducing entry barriers, and increasing capital efficiency. It <strong>creates a positive feedback loop</strong> that strengthens Ethereum’s network security while enabling new DeFi opportunities.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>restaking protocols extend staking benefits to Layer 2s, bridges, and oracles</strong>, further enhancing Ethereum’s ecosystem.</p>

<p>As liquid staking evolves, <strong>balancing decentralization, regulation, and security</strong> will be crucial for its long-term success.</p>
